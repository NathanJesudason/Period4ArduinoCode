# Period 4 Code for Arduino Projects
By Hunter Key, Nathan Jesudason, Morgan Thomas, Robert Johnk, Liam Dunbar, Reydarren Monzon and Lucian

This repository holds the updated code for each arduino project on the Arduino Poster in Mr.Walker's room. Corresponding student and project names are given for each program. 

# Projects include:
- A Morse Code machine
- A binary counter
- A music speaker that plays a Mario song on repeat
- A touch activated lightboard

and more once other group members put in their code (-_-)


Please enjoy this code and feel free to test out any of these projects with an Arduino of your own. This is an open source project to show off the capabilities and benefits of Arduinos.
